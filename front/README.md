# Comments

1) I use material-ui for the components: https://material-ui.com/es/
2) I use @giantmachines/redux-websocket for the websocket connection
3) Make sure you have the server running in order to get data from it
4) Make sure you have the ports 3000 and 3001 free to run front and back apps

# TODO's

1) Better display of boxes. Sometimes there is too much whitespace
